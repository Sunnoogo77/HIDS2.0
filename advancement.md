## 🧭 GLOBAL CONTEXT — Where We Are

Your project **HIDS-Web 2.0** is a **full-stack host-based intrusion detection dashboard**, consisting of:

* **Backend (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)** → performs file/folder/IP monitoring, logging, alert generation, scheduling, etc.
* **Frontend (React + Tailwind)** → displays reports, alerts, and live monitoring dashboards.
* **Running in Docker** → services orchestrated via `docker-compose`.

So far, the backend automatically scans monitored entities, logs activities and alerts, and the frontend renders both.

---

## 🔥 CURRENT MODULE IN FOCUS: “ALERTS & LOGS”

We’re working on the **core alerting pipeline** — ensuring that:

1. Alerts (file/folder/IP modifications) are **correctly created** when detected.
2. Alerts are **written to the correct log file** (`alerts.log`) rather than mixed into `hids.log`.
3. The frontend (`AlertsLogs.jsx`) **displays them dynamically** — ideally without manual page refresh.

---

## 🧩 WHAT WE RECENTLY DID (last 3 major steps)

### 1️⃣ **Log System Consolidation**

We examined and cleaned up several backend logging routes:

* `backend_logs.py`, `hids_logs.py`, and `logs.py` were reviewed.
* We decided to **unify the access layer** via `/api/logs/hids` so the frontend can fetch logs (activity or alerts) with parameters like `type`, `page`, `level`, and `contains`.

✅ *Result:* Logs can now be fetched cleanly through one API route.

---

### 2️⃣ **Scanning and Alert Writing**

We inspected your main scanning engine `scan_tasks.py`, which handles:

* File integrity verification (hash comparison)
* Folder fingerprint changes
* IP activity detection

The issue found:
🟥 All alerts and activities were being written to **the same file (`hids.log`)**, meaning alerts didn’t show up under the "Alerts" tab.

✅ *Planned fix:* introduce **two distinct loggers**:

* `activity_logger` → writes to `logs/hids.log`
* `alert_logger` → writes to `logs/alerts.log`

That’s the code I showed you above (the full rewrite version was pending your confirmation).

---

### 3️⃣ **Frontend Reports & Live Update Improvements**

We finished the **Reports** page visual refresh:

* Fixed date rendering issues (now shows correct local date/time).
* Re-arranged layout (2 cards per row).
* Added a distribution pie chart.
* Improved spacing and balance.

Then, in the **Alerts & Logs** page (`AlertsLogs.jsx`):

* We improved log filtering (Level, Search).
* Designed nice color badges for alert severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO).
* Identified that data refresh was manual → proposed adding **auto-refresh (polling every 5 s)**.

✅ *Result:* Frontend is visually ready; just needs auto-refresh and the backend alert separation to display live alerts properly.

## ⚠️ WHAT IS STILL OPEN / NEEDS FINALIZATION

| Area                       | Status          | Next Step                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Separate alert logging** | 🟠 In progress  | Finalize the `scan_tasks.py` rewrite with two loggers (`hids.log` + `alerts.log`).                                                           |
| **Auto refresh (polling)** | 🟠 Proposed     | Implement the small polling snippet in `AlertsLogs.jsx` so logs update live.                                                                 |
| **Test environment setup** | 🟢 Ready        | You now have access to the container (`docker exec -it hids20-api-1 bash`) — we can place monitored files/folders and trigger modifications. |
| **Real alert test**        | 🔴 Not yet done | Once the new logger is in place, modify a monitored file to ensure an alert entry is created and appears in `alerts.log`.                    |

## 🚀 IF YOU WANT TO ADVANCE SLIGHTLY BEFORE YOUR BREAK

Here’s what I suggest — one short, meaningful push:

### ✅ Step Plan (≈ 30 min task)

1. **Replace** your `scan_tasks.py` with the fixed version (I can provide the full ready-to-paste file).
2. **Restart the backend container** (`docker compose up -d --build`).
3. **Inside the container**, create a test folder `/app/test_watch` and add a text file inside.
4. **Add that path** in your frontend “Surveillance” page.
5. **Modify the file** inside the container → confirm that:

   * A new entry appears in `/app/logs/alerts.log`
   * It appears automatically (or after refresh) in the **Alerts** tab.

That’s a full end-to-end proof of detection and alerting.

After that, you’ll have a completely validated alert pipeline 👏
